# Kotlin Weather & Lucky Days Analysis

This project analyzes historical data from the island of Kotlin (starting in 1710)
and calculates:
- The number of hurricane days (wind speed â‰¥ 33 m/s)
- The percentage of "lucky" recycling days based on activity logs

All data is stored in an SQLite database (`practise.db`).
